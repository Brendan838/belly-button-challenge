## Overview

This repository contains the completed homework assignment for the **Belly Button Challenge** for the U of MN Data Analytics & Visualization bootcamp. 

In this project I was given an html file, and asked to make a functional dashboard using the d3 and Plotly javascript libraries to display data from the Belly Button Bidiversity dataset,  which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Instructions
- Clone repo and click index.html to view the dashboard, or view on github pages.
